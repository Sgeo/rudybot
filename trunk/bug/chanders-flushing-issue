<offby1> eli barzilay would _really_ like to see someone break rudybot's eval
<chandler> oh, you missed the flushing issue I had earlier                                 [17:36]
<chandler> rudybot: eval (make-string 500 #\a)
<offby1> aha!
<chandler> ... no answer
<chandler> rudybot: eval 1
<rudybot>
          "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<chandler> where's the answer to "eval 1"?
<offby1> I suspect he'll always get back to you eventually, but something about long strings
         makes him slow down.
<chandler> rudybot: eval 1
<rudybot> 1:""
<offby1> rudybot: eval 2                                                                   [17:37]
<rudybot> 2:""
<offby1> wow
<offby1> you're right
<chandler> no, it's some kind of flushing issue
<offby1> a new entry for my TODO list!
<offby1> at least he doesn't leave the seat up.
<chandler> rudybot: eval (string-length (make-string 500 #\a))
<rudybot> 500:""
<chandler> rudybot: eval call/cc
<rudybot> #<primitive:call-with-current-continuation>:""
<offby1> the Queens Monthly Reporter just released a special "Flushing" issue.             [17:38]
<offby1> I guess it has to do with _outputting_ long strings, not merely _generating_ them.
