Doesn't "related work" sound grandly academic?

Anyway, here are some other bots, and bot-related code, that I know
of:

* https://svn.bountysource.com/scm-irc/trunk

* http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/irc.html
  (not a bot, really; just a library)

* http://monkeyboy.td.org.uit.no/~cin/feckbot

  Cin is often in #scheme. Feckbot contains the funniest bot code I've
  ever seen: the "tourettes" command.  Describing it is hopeless; just
  try it.

* http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/cia/ -- CIA.  A pretty serious bot,
  probably carefully designed

* http://poe.perl.org/?POE_Cookbook/IRC_Bots

* buubot: svn://erxz.com/bb2/trunk

* Eric Tiedemann, creator of e7, mentioned http://inamidst.com/phenny/

* "wayita": http://repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk/src/
  "Sabor"'s replacement of ayita on #svn

* Eli Barzilay slapped together a bot, mostly as an example for me; it
  was last seen on, I think, http://something.barzilay.org
