2008-08-15T04:59:16Z => "PRIVMSG #emacs :offby1: lavaramano was seen quitting in/on main10102.dc8.debconf.org twenty-three hours, twenty minutes ago, saying \"\"leaving\"\", and then lavaramano was seen joining in/on :#emacs eleven hours, eleven minutes ago"

So why didn't it describe the QUIT that happened 6 minutes earlier?!
