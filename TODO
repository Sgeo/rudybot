<leppie> not sure how you would feed a top level R6RS program to rudybot                   [08:48]
<chandler> rudybot needs an eval-paste                                                     [08:49]
<leppie> eval-paste?
<Daemmerung> eval contents of a pastebin.
<chandler> yeah, something like rudybot: eval-paste 70573
<leppie> ahh
<chandler> offby1: make it so!                                                             [08:50]
