* Roll the log file over
that is, don't let it grow without bound, but instead, once it gets to
a certain size, rename it and start a new file.

It might be easiest to invoke "multilog" from Dan Bernstein's
"daemontools" (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz ;
available on Ubuntu 10.04 in the "daemontools" package)

* Consider making the log a sequence of sexprs
rather than lines: this will make it easier for programs to parse
... and it seems I'm writing more programs that want to parse it.

* Get rid of "in/on" in the output of the "seen" command
surely I can figure out which preposition is appropriate.

* Run with "--warn info"
... and fix the various lint-like warnings that come up

* Put the persistent data someplace safe
That's the big-log (which we mine for incubot-witticisms) and the
userinfo db.  I keep accidentally deleting them, and losing months of
accumulated data; they should be on S3 or something.

Someone suggested Dropbox; that could work!

* Incubot
** Omit leading nicks from utterances
The original incubot does this.  E.g., if we find
: ":offby1!n=user@pdpc/supporter/monthlybyte/offby1 PRIVMSG #scheme :rudybot: seen eli"
in the log, then we currently reduce that to
: "rudybot: seen eli"
but we should really omit the leading nick and colon, yielding
: "seen eli"
That's because it looks odd for the bot to utter something that's
directed at someone who probably isn't present.
** Entirely omit, or at least trim, ACTION
I just saw the bot respond with "\1ACTION does something or other\1",
which was weird; it should have either said nothing, or else just
"does something or other".
** Use the same logic ...
... to initially create "parsed-log", as to add individual utterances
to it.

For example, I'm pretty sure I omit utterances that are addressed to
the bot, and begin with a command; i.e., when jordanb says "rudybot:
quote", I don't add that, since it'd be dull.

And yet when log-parser creates parsed-log, it blithely adds
everything.

** Underweight recent utterances

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<jordanb> Offby1 should make a lolbot.
<offby1> already did
<jordanb> Heh
<jordanb> Have it join. ^_^
<jordanb> rudybot: lol
<rudybot> jordanb: lol
<jordanb> rudybot: lolbot                                                                                           [16:19]
<rudybot> jordanb: Offby1 should make a lolbot.
<jordanb> O                                                                                                         [16:21]
* offby1 makes a mental note to underweight recent utterances
<jordanb> I'm using emacs over X because it's less broken than tramp.

* Use 'racket-lang' URLs in output of "doc"
Note the below interaction (version 738f2ae if it matters)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<Daemmerung> rudybot: doc even?
<rudybot> Daemmerung:                                                                                 
                                                                                                      
http://docs.plt-scheme.org/reference/number-types.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._even~3f))
#+END_EXAMPLE
It'd be nice if that URL began with "docs.racket-lang.org" rather than
"docs.plt-scheme.org".
