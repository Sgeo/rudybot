* Roll the log file over
that is, don't let it grow without bound, but instead, once it gets to
a certain size, rename it and start a new file.

* Consider making the log a sequence of sexprs
rather than lines: this will make it easier for programs to parse
... and it seems I'm writing more programs that want to parse it.

* Get rid of "in/on" in the output of the "seen" command
surely I can figure out which preposition is appropriate.

* Run with "--warn info"
... and fix the various lint-like warnings that come up

* Put the persistent data someplace safe
That's the big-log (which we mine for incubot-witticisms) and the
userinfo db.  I keep accidentally deleting them, and losing months of
accumulated data; they should be on S3 or something.

Someone suggested Dropbox; that could work!

* Incubot
** Omit leading nicks from utterances
The original incubot does this.  E.g., if we find
: ":offby1!n=user@pdpc/supporter/monthlybyte/offby1 PRIVMSG #scheme :rudybot: seen eli"
in the log, then we currently reduce that to
: "rudybot: seen eli"
but we should really omit the leading nick and colon, yielding
: "seen eli"
That's because it looks odd for the bot to utter something that's
directed at someone who probably isn't present.
** Entirely omit, or at least trim, ACTION
I just saw the bot respond with "\1ACTION does something or other\1",
which was weird; it should have either said nothing, or else jsut
"does something or other". 
** Use the same logic ...
... to initially create "parsed-log", as to add individual utterances
to it.

For example, I'm pretty sure I omit utterances that are addressed to
the bot, and begin with a command; i.e., when jordanb says "rudybot:
quote", I don't add that, since it'd be dull.

And yet when log-parser creates parsed-log, it blithely adds
everything.
