* Roll the log file over
that is, don't let it grow without bound, but instead, once it gets to
a certain size, rename it and start a new file.

* Consider making the log a sequence of sexprs
rather than lines: this will make it easier for programs to parse
... and it seems I'm writing more programs that want to parse it.

* Get rid of "in/on" in the output of the "seen" command
surely I can figure out which preposition is appropriate.

* Run with "--warn info"
... and fix the various lint-like warnings that come up

* Put the persistent data someplace safe
That's the big-log (which we mine for incubot-witticisms) and the
userinfo db.  I keep accidentally deleting them, and losing months of
accumulated data; they should be on S3 or something.
