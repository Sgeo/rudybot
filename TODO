<leppie> not sure how you would feed a top level R6RS program to rudybot
<chandler> rudybot needs an eval-paste
<leppie> eval-paste?
<Daemmerung> eval contents of a pastebin.
<chandler> yeah, something like rudybot: eval-paste 70573
<leppie> ahh
<chandler> offby1: make it so!

<leppie> maybe rudybot can have a r6rs-eval call?

Roll the log file over: that is, don't let it grow without bound, but
instead, once it gets to a certain size, rename it and start a new
file.

Consider making the log a sequence of sexprs, rather than lines: this
will make it easier for programs to parse ... and it seems I'm writing
more programs that want to parse it.

Get rid of "in/on" in the output of the "seen" command; surely I can
figure out which preposition is appropriate.

<vixey> how did you do that o_o                                                            [06:42]
<mejja> It'a a known floating point gotcha.                                                [06:43]

<eli> note that just above that there were two cases where people tried to use other people's
      functions,                                                                           [08:14]
<eli> and I still think that implementing something like:
<eli> rudybot: eval (define blah ...)
<rudybot> eli: error: eval:1:13: ...: ellipses not allowed as an expression in: ...
<eli> rudybot: give offby1 blah
<eli> would be very interesting.
