<leppie> not sure how you would feed a top level R6RS program to rudybot
<chandler> rudybot needs an eval-paste
<leppie> eval-paste?
<Daemmerung> eval contents of a pastebin.
<chandler> yeah, something like rudybot: eval-paste 70573
<leppie> ahh
<chandler> offby1: make it so!

<leppie> maybe rudybot can have a r6rs-eval call?

The sightings.db directory currently has about 8,000 entries, which is
kind of alarming.  Maybe reorganize it so that, e.g., sightings for
"fred" go into f/fred (that way sightings.db will contain at most
perhaps 100 entries).

Roll the log file over: that is, don't let it grow without bound, but
instead, once it gets to a certain size, rename it and start a new
file.
