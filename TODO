An idea for the Sightings feature:

Rather than keeping the info in a big hash table, keep it in a
directory full of little files.  Each file's name is a nick; its
contents are the last thing they said (the whole line, as received
from the server).  Maybe the last _two_ things they said, so that when
they quit, I can report both the quit message, and the previous
utterance.  And timestamps on each line -- either in the file, or just
the metadata on the file.

And rather than using the nick exactly as seen from the server,
"canonicalize" it, for two purposes:

1) to ensure it is a valid file name; and
2) to remove trailing punctuation like ` _, so that a nick like
"jordanb`" gets saved under "jordanb"
