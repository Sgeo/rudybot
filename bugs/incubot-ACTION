<offby1> what's the ACTION thing?                                                         [03:18]
<ijp> if I did say                                                                        [03:19]
* ijp is bored
<ijp> and that was the match, you get "ACTION is bored"

Meaning: the word ACTION gets put into the incubot database; it needs
to be stripped off.
