I've seen this in the repl a few times (at r11, e.g.); I cannot
reproduce it, don't know what's causing it.  On the other hand, it
doesn't seem to cause any lasting damage.

     === context ===
    /home/offby1/local/stow/plt/lib/plt/collects/mzlib/private/match/match-error.ss:9:4: match:error
    send-request
    recent-posts
    loop
    /home/offby1/new-bot/bot.ss:391:14: loop

It looks like the function "send-request", in delicious.plt, is
failing to handle the case where "res-headers" doesn't match the
regexp http-code-regexp ... but that's just a guess; I don't really
know what's going on.

  asking for help.
