This is Racket 5.2.1 on Ubuntu 11.10 ("Oneiric Ocelot").

I think "query-value" is, somehow, leaking memory.  To demonstrate:

        $ ./leaky.rkt & top

Note the memory usage of racket increases by a couple of megabytes per
second, apparently without bound.

"leaky.rkt" displays the value returned by (current-memory-use), and
that number doesn't ever get particularly large; this suggests the
problem is somewhere in FFI-land.

Now edit corpus.rkt, by changing the defintion of *leak?* from #t to
#f, and run it again; this time it doesn't leak.
