Inspired by "incubot" (sorry, no URL), a bot in #scheme on freenode.org in 2008.

The general idea is: you give it a word, and it finds and echoes some
sentence from IRC logs that contains that word.

Actually the original incubot took a whole sentence, and (somehow)
chose a word from that sentence.

For example:

    <proq> incubot: if they don't have internet, there's always the paper
    <incubot> business networking in an internet chat room for scheme programmers is hilarious

Here incubot chose the word "internet", and spewed forth a sentence
containing that word.

I suspect that it chooses the "most interesting" word from the input
sentence, where "interesting" basically means "rare in the corpus".
